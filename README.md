# POO
Java project for the POO class

## What's the point?
In this project we were meant to create an UBER like company with our own implementations of clients, drivers and vehicles.
We decided to make a GUI so it would be easier to test and use.

## And how am I supposed to use it?
You can run the GUI by running:
```
$ java GUI
```
in the terminal.

## Ok, I dig it. And who can I thank for this awesome project?
